# ya can test it, can't post tho
This is a personal project. To post, you need to set a password (type your password in the title box followed by "@@" to set the password). You are welcome to check out the source code though, or try it out (it'll still convert the body if you don't pass/pass the wrong password).

I built this upon my other repository, [create-react-electron-app](https://github.com/imp-dance/create-react-electron-app), which might be more interesting to check out.
